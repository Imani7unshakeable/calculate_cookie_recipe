# class Ingredients:
sugar = 1.5
butter = 1
flour = 2.75
cookies = 48

# totalFLour = (flour x number_of_cookies)/cookies

# Define ingredient quantities for 48 cookies
sugar_per_cookie = 1.5 / 48  # 1.5 cups of sugar divided by 48 cookies
butter_per_cookie = 1 / 48   # 1 cup of butter divided by 48 cookies
flour_per_cookie = 2.75 / 48  # 2.75 cups of flour divided by 48 cookies

# Ask the user how many cookies they want to make
num_cookies = int(input("Enter the number of cookies you want to make: "))

# Calculate adjusted ingredient quantities
sugar_needed = sugar_per_cookie * num_cookies
butter_needed = butter_per_cookie * num_cookies
flour_needed = flour_per_cookie * num_cookies

# Display the adjusted ingredient quantities
print(f"For {num_cookies} cookies, you'll need:")
print(f"{sugar_needed:.2f} cups of sugar")
print(f"{butter_needed:.2f} cups of butter")
print(f"{flour_needed:.2f} cups of flour")
